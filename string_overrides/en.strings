Tantalus was the king of Mt Sipylus in Lydia, and wanting to make an offering to the gods he cut his son Pelops to pieces to serve to them. Fortunately for Pelops, the gods (except Demeter, who accidentally ate his shoulder; he got a new one though) brought him back to life. Pelops became a lover of Poseidon, but having fallen out of favour with him he went to Olympia to compete for the hand of princess Hippodamia in a chariot race. He enlisted the help of his opponent's charioteer Myrtilus, asking him to sabotage his chariot, but ended up killing him in revenge for an attempt by Myrtilus to rape Hippodamia. Myrtilus cursed him as he died.\n\nThis was the source of the great curse on Agammemnon's family. Pelops' went on to gain dominion over the Peloponnese (hence the name of the peninsula, 'Pelops' Island'). His sons, Atreus and Thyestes, were banished from Olympia for murdering their step-brother, and they fled to Mycenae where they took up power. After establishing his own kingship, Atreus discovered his brother's affair with his wife and served him his own children to eat in revenge. Thyestes' son, Aegisthus, would go on to kill Atreus.\n\nNow Atreus is dead, and his son Agammemnon, having driven out Aegisthus and Thyestes, is the ruler of Mycenae. Mycenae holds a strategically important position in the Peloponnese, controlling access to the fertile plain of Argos and the isthmus connecting the peninsula with the rest of Greece. As such, the city has great potential, but it is surrounded by rivals, most notably Argos and Athens. These two cities will need to be brought to heel, preferably as protectorates if ultimate conquest proves unfeasible, but the Mycenaeans have the resources with which to do this. They have fine charioteers and warriors, and under the right direction, the city will no doubt flourish.";

The city itself was built by his son Ilus (so it is sometimes referred to as Ilium). The walls were built by Poseidon and Apollo for Ilus' son Laomedon, and the city was the mightiest in the land.\n\nBut Laomedon refused to pay Poseidon and Apollo for their aid. Poseidon flooded the land, pestilence and plague came, and a great sea monster tormented the Trojans. Finally the hero Heracles came and killed Laomedon and all his sons save for Priam. Priam had bribed Heracles with a golden veil made by his sister Hesione, and so escaped destruction. He had numerous wives, the first of which was Arisbe, though the most notable was Hecabe - she bore him twenty children in total, the most famous of which were Hector, Paris and Aeneas (the future founder of the Roman nation).\n\nTroy is a rich city - stupendously rich. Lying along the important Hellespontine trade routes, it draws much money in taxes. This draws the jealousy of many nations, and war is something that the Trojans have had to live with for quite some time. It has strong soldiers and a great defender in the person of Priam's young son Hector, but nonetheless it has a precarious position. But naturally its riches aren't merely a threat - they can be put to good use in defence of the city, and possibly even foreign expansion. Troy is well placed to dominate the Northern Aegean and the plains of Mysia that lie behind it; a wise ruler could do very well indeed with such a city.";

It was founded by Phoroneus, son of the river god Inachus, and said to be the first man in existence. He ruled over the whole of what would later be known as the Peloponnese, and his daughter Niobe (the first mortal woman to be loved by Zeus) gave birth to Argos, who named the city after himself. Later on, the city was taken over by Danaus. He had fled from Egypt with his fifty daughters (the Danaids) who had been pledged to marry their cousins against their will and on arrival in Argos assumed the throne from the native King Gelanor. As a result, the Greeks are often referred to in general as Danaans. The Egyptians did chase Danaus down, and he had to consent to his daughters' marriage to their cousins; however, during the night, they murdered their new husbands. Only one of them survived, a certain Lynceus, and he took over the throne of Argos after Danaus' death.\n\nSince then Argive history has been colourful and complex. One of the most notable recent deeds was the war of the Seven Against Thebes (later to be immortalised by the playwright Aeschylus), one of whom was from Argos. They were killed, but their sons, including the current King Sthenelus, known as the Epigonoi (descendants), took revenge on Thebes. Now Sthenelus rules supreme over Argos, and the city is generally flourishing. It is a rich and important trading city, and is second only to Mycenae and Sparta in the Peloponnese. Certainly it is more than capable of playing a leading role in Greece in the years to come. ";

One of Proetus' subjects, Bellerophon, came to blows with Proetus (over Proetus' wife) and Proetus gave him a letter to take to Iobates of Lycia. The letter told Iobates to kill Bellerophon. Iobates sent Bellerophon to kill the Chimera (believing that it would kill Bellerophon), but Bellerophon managed to triumph by riding the winged horse Pegasus and shooting the Chimera from above. Then he sent Bellerophon against the Solymni and the Amazons, but again Bellerophon was victorious. Iobates concluded that Bellerophon was loved by the gods, and bequeathed him his daughter Philonoe and his kingdom when he died.\n\nNow Lycia is ruled by King Sarpedon, grandson of Bellerophon and son of Zeus and Laodamia (Bellerophon's daughter). Zeus granted Sarpedon a life for three generations*, but he can still be killed in battle. The Lycians are most famous for their great skill at archery, and they are unmatched by any other nation. This is a powerful asset. They are also well situated in their capital of Telmessos for naval trade and expansion; they have plenty of resources for becoming a very powerful faction indeed.\n\n* Sarpedon would however be killed by Patroclus at Troy.";

They held an athletics contest, and Telamon threw a quoit at Phocus' head, killing him.

Peleus then set out with Jason and the Argonauts, and, once his fame had spread, joined the hunt of the Calydonian boar. After various intrigues involving the wife of the King of Iolcus, Peleus went on to capture the city. His wife Antigone had killed herself at the shame of Peleus' involvement with Astydamia of Iolcus, and Peleus ended up marrying the nymph Thetis, who bore him one of the most famous of all Greek heroes, Achilles.\n\nNow old Peleus rules in Phthia and his young son Achilles has become well accustomed to the ways of war in Greece. Phthia is not the richest or most famous of the cities, and it is not a great centre of military power. However, with the right governance and good use of its famous Myrmidons, among its other troops, the Phthian kingdom could well come to dominate Northern and central Greece.
