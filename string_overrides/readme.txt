This folder is used to override strings added to the game by Feral Interactive.
The original files can be found at "<languageCode>.lproj/Localizable_Game.strings"
Override files should be named the language code they correspond with and have the file extension, ".strings"
E.G. English Override: "en.strings"

Only strings that you wish to change need to be added to the new files. Any strings not present in them will be taken from the original files.
